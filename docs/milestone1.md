## Data Interactions and Important Data components
There have been updates and clarifications to the data interactions and components presented in Milestone 0
* Home Page: The Home-page is the page where people will find others like them. People will be able to posts by other people
who want to find workout partners and they can even filter the posts to find a good match for them. People can interact with the posts by clicking an "I'm interested" button.
* Create a Post page: This is the place where people can create posts/make requests and specify certain aspects of their activity such as the duration and the day.
* Clubs and News page: This page contains a list of fitness clubs as well as popular sports news from the campus.
* Account Page: This page was chosen in place of the highlights page. It offers people the chance to view their own posts as well as see the people interested in their posts and send those people emails if necessary. Users can also delete their own posts if required.
* Log in/Sign Up: Log in and Sign up have been implemented as Bootstrap modals containing forms that pop-up once the Log In and Sign up buttons are clicked in the navbar.

## Wireframes

### My Account
![alt text](https://github.com/AdityaUmass/cs326-final-theta/blob/master/Images/MyAccountWireframe.png?raw=true)
The my account web page allows a signed-in user to see the posts that they have uploaded to the website. Apart from just viewing their posts, this webpage allows users to update, delete, and even see the other users who have shown an interest in the activity. The user can see the emails of each post's interested users and send them a bulk email via a modal.

### Home/Posts page
![Home/Posts page](https://github.com/AdityaUmass/cs326-final-theta/blob/master/Images/PostpageWireframe.png)
This shows the general layout of the home page which also shows the posts from our users. On the left, the filters stay fixed in place so that you can change the types of posts you see based on their characteristics (Workout Type, Day, Duration, etc). When you click "Single Day Activity", an input will be toggled asking to specify the date of the activity. When you click "Repeated Activity", It will ask you two pick days from a set of days provided. On the right, you can freely scroll the relevant posts based on filters you set or otherwise. You can also interact with the posts by clicking a button to show you are interested, which will reflect in the Accounts page of whoever made that post as well as increment the displayed value for number of people interested.

### Make a Post page
![Make a Post page](https://github.com/AdityaUmass/cs326-final-theta/blob/master/Images/MakePostWireframe.png)
This is the page where users can make a post that will be displayed on the Home page. As can be seen, apart from title and content, there are also multiple specifiers such as Activity Type and Workout Type that show up as filters on the home page. When you click "Single Day Activity", an input will be toggled asking to specify the date of the activity. When you click "Repeated Activity", It will ask you two pick days from a set of days provided. After setting the filters, filling in the content, and specifying contact information, you can make the post and the home page will be updated.
