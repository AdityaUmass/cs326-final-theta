## Data Interactions and Important Data components
There have been updates and clarifications to the data interactions and components presented in Milestone 0
* Home Page: The Home-page is the page where people will find others like them. People will be able to posts by other people
who want to find workout partners and they can even filter the posts to find a good match for them. People can interact with the posts by clicking an "I'm interested" button.
* Create a Post page: This is the place where people can create posts/make requests and specify certain aspects of their activity such as the duration and the day.
* Clubs and News page: This page contains a list of fitness clubs as well as popular sports news from the campus.
* Account Page: This page was chosen in place of the highlights page. It offers people the chance to view their own posts as well as see the people interested in their posts and send those people emails if necessary. Users can also delete their own posts if required.
* Log in/Sign Up: Log in and Sign up have been implemented as Bootstrap modals containing forms that pop-up once the Log In and Sign up buttons are clicked in the navbar.
