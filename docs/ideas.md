### Innovative Idea
Getting fit can be hard, and it can also be an intimidating to start out on your fitness journey. We plan to make this process more welcoming to people and help people find others who have similar goals to them. With our app, we seek to try and connect people who have similar fitness goals and plans. In order to encourage people to continue on their fitness journey, UMass students will also be able to share their fitness achievements on this website. We also want to provide a place for UMass students to get better awareness of the sporting events and opportunities offered on campus. While there are applications like Strava that help people connect with other people on the fitness app, this project stands out in being uniquely catered to UMass Amherst students. That means it will be easier for people to get knowledge of fitness activities and opportunities specific to UMass Amherst thanks to this app, as well as feel connected to the community at large.

### Important Components
There are certain key components that will be a part of the project. There will be a request section for people to find others whowant to work out with them. There will be a section for people to simply upload their achievements and that can be achieved in many ways via pictures, stats, or text. 

For more general information, there will be a section to inform people of UMass clubs that offer sports and other physical activities. Finally, we also plan to include a news section to inform people about popular sports events taking place on campus.
